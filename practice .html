   <b> formatting</b> commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to<u> manually</u> format documents. However, the <strong>SGML</strong> concept of <del>generalized</del> markup is based on elements <i>nested annotated ranges with attributes</i> rather than merely print effects, <em>with separate structure and markup</em>. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with <strong>CSS</strong>.
